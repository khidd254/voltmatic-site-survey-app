# Standalone APK Installation Guide

## Method 1: Online APK Builder (Recommended - No Coding Required)

### Using Replit.com
1. **Go to Replit.com** and create free account
2. **Create new Repl** → Import from GitHub or upload files
3. **Upload your entire project folder**
4. **Install buildozer** in Replit terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install buildozer cython==0.29.33
   ```
5. **Build APK**:
   ```bash
   buildozer android debug
   ```
6. **Download APK** from `bin/` folder
7. **Install on phone** - enable "Unknown Sources" in Android settings

### Using GitHub Actions (Automated)
1. **Create GitHub account** (free)
2. **Upload your project** to GitHub repository
3. **GitHub automatically builds APK** using the workflow I created
4. **Download APK** from Actions → Artifacts
5. **Install on phone**

## Method 2: Ask Someone with Linux/Mac
1. **Copy project folder** to USB drive
2. **Ask friend with Linux/Mac** to run:
   ```bash
   buildozer android debug
   ```
3. **Get APK file** from `bin/` folder
4. **Install on your phone**

## Method 3: Use Android Studio (More Complex)
1. **Install Android Studio**
2. **Create new project** with Python support (Chaquopy plugin)
3. **Import your Python files**
4. **Build APK** through Android Studio
5. **Install on phone**

## Installation Steps (Once you have APK):
1. **Enable Unknown Sources**:
   - Settings → Security → Unknown Sources → Enable
2. **Transfer APK** to phone (USB/email/cloud)
3. **Tap APK file** → Install
4. **App appears** in your app drawer like any other app

## Recommended Path:
**Use Replit.com method** - it's free, online, and requires no local setup. Just upload your files and build the APK in the cloud.

The GitHub Actions workflow I created will automatically build APKs whenever you update your code.
